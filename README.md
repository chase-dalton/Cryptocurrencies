# Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report to potentially be used by investors to propose cryptocurrency investments in their client's portfolios. By preprocessing the data and reducing data dimensions with PCA (Principal Component Analysis), clustering the cryptocurrencies using K-means, and visualizing the results, I was able to use unsupervised machine learning to group cryptocurrencies into distinct classifications for potential use in influencing cryptocurrency investment.
